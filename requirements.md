The goal of this project is to develop a habit-tracking mobile application that replicates the core functionality of Habitify while introducing additional features such as multi-user support with data separation, streak tracking, motivational pop-ups (similar to Duolingo), dark mode, and stock icons for categories and habits. The app will be designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure an optimal user experience on iOS and Android devices.

Objectives
Create a user-friendly, intuitive habit-tracking app.
Support multiple users with strict data separation for privacy.
Implement engaging features like streaks and motivational pop-ups to improve user retention.
Ensure the app is visually appealing and functional in both light and dark modes.
Provide stock icons for categories and habits to enhance usability.
Allow users to delete habits and categories as needed.
Target Audience
Individuals seeking to build and track daily habits.
Users who value gamification (streaks, pop-ups) to stay motivated.
Users who prefer a clean, modern UI with dark mode support and visual aids like icons.
Development Environment
This project will be developed using Cursor, an AI-powered IDE, to streamline coding, debugging, and project management. The app will leverage cross-platform frameworks (e.g., Flutter or React Native) to ensure compatibility with both iOS and Android.

Functional Requirements
1. User Management
1.1 Multi-User Support
The app must allow multiple users to create accounts and use the app on the same device or across devices.
Users must register with a unique email address and password.
Support login via email/password and optionally social logins (e.g., Google, Apple).
Each user’s data must be stored separately to ensure privacy and data isolation.
1.2 Data Separation
User data (habits, streaks, settings) must be stored in a secure, user-specific database or cloud storage.
Ensure no cross-user data leakage (e.g., one user cannot access another user’s habits).
Implement secure session management to prevent unauthorized access to user data.
1.3 User Profiles
Users can view and edit their profile, including username, email, and optional profile picture.
Users can log out of their account and switch between accounts on the same device.
2. Habit Tracking (Core Functionality)
2.1 Habit Creation
Users can create new habits with the following attributes:
Name: A short title for the habit (e.g., "Drink Water").
Category: Group habits into categories (e.g., Health, Productivity). Predefined categories should be available, with the option to create custom ones.
Frequency: Daily, weekly, or custom (e.g., 3 times a week).
Time of Day: Optional reminder time (e.g., morning, evening).
Goal: Optional numerical goal (e.g., "Drink 8 glasses of water").
Notes: Optional field for additional details.
Icon: Users can select a stock icon for the habit from a predefined set (e.g., a water droplet for "Drink Water", a book for "Read"). Custom icons can be added in future updates.
Provide a visual picker for selecting stock icons during habit creation.
2.2 Habit Tracking
Users can mark habits as completed on a daily/weekly basis.
Display a calendar view showing completed and missed habits.
Provide a "Today" view listing all habits due for the current day.
Allow users to edit or delete existing habits.
Deletion: Users can delete any habit with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidental deletion.
2.3 Categories
Users can create, edit, and delete categories.
Creation: Users can create custom categories with a name and a stock icon selected from a predefined set (e.g., a heart for "Health", a briefcase for "Work").
Editing: Users can update the name and icon of a category.
Deletion: Users can delete any category with a confirmation prompt. Deleting a category should:
Prompt the user to either delete all habits within the category or move them to another category (e.g., "Uncategorized").
Provide a visual picker for selecting stock icons during category creation or editing.
2.4 Streak Functionality
Track and display streaks for each habit (e.g., "7 days in a row").
Reset streaks if the user misses a habit’s required frequency (e.g., skips a daily habit).
Highlight milestones (e.g., 7, 14, 30, 100 days) with celebratory animations or badges.
Display a streak summary in the user’s profile or dashboard.
3. Notifications and Pop-Ups
3.1 Reminders
Send push notifications to remind users of pending habits based on their set time of day.
Allow users to customize notification settings (e.g., enable/disable, snooze).
3.2 Duolingo-Style Motivational Pop-Ups
Implement engaging pop-ups to motivate users, similar to Duolingo’s gamified approach:
Streak Reminders: Warn users if they are about to lose a streak (e.g., "Don’t break your 5-day streak! Complete your habits now!").
Celebratory Pop-Ups: Congratulate users on milestones (e.g., "Amazing! You’ve completed your habits 10 days in a row!").
Encouragement Pop-Ups: Encourage users after missing a habit (e.g., "It’s okay to miss a day! Start fresh today!").
Pop-ups should include animations, emojis, or mascots to enhance engagement.
Allow users to disable motivational pop-ups in settings.
4. User Interface and Experience
4.1 Mobile-First Design

Use a clean, minimalistic UI similar to Habitify, with intuitive navigation.
Implement touch-friendly elements (e.g., large buttons, swipe gestures).
4.2 Dashboard
Provide a dashboard summarizing the user’s progress:
Today’s habits (with completion status and associated icons).
Current streaks.
Overall habit completion rate (e.g., "75% of habits completed this week").
Include quick access to habit creation, category management, and settings.
4.3 Dark Mode
Implement a dark mode theme that can be toggled manually or set to follow the system theme.
Ensure all UI elements (text, buttons, backgrounds, icons) are legible and visually appealing in both light and dark modes.
Use consistent color schemes (e.g., light gray text on dark backgrounds, high-contrast buttons).
4.4 Animations
Add subtle animations to enhance the user experience (e.g., checkmark animation when marking a habit as complete, fade-in for pop-ups).
Ensure animations are lightweight and do not impact performance on low-end devices.
4.5 Icon Integration
Provide a library of stock icons for habits and categories, categorized by theme (e.g., Health, Productivity, Fitness, Leisure).
Icons should be high-quality, vector-based (e.g., SVG format) to ensure scalability and clarity on all screen sizes.
Display icons in habit lists, category views, and creation/editing screens to improve visual recognition.
5. Settings
Provide a settings menu where users can:
Toggle dark mode.
Enable/disable notifications and pop-ups.
Manage account details (e.g., change password, delete account).
Export/import habit data (e.g., as JSON or CSV).
Clear all data (with confirmation prompt).
6. Analytics and Insights
Provide a statistics page showing:
Habit completion rate over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
Longest streak for each habit.
Most consistent habits (e.g., habits with the highest completion rate).
Use charts or graphs to visualize data (e.g., bar chart for weekly completion, line chart for streaks).
Display habit and category icons in the statistics view for better context.
