# General Coding Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all development.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability in all code.
- Ensure function and variable names are clear and descriptive, following TypeScript/JavaScript naming conventions:
  - Use `camelCase` for variables, functions, and parameters.
  - Use `PascalCase` for React components, classes, and interfaces.
  - Use `UPPER_CASE` for constants.
- Use concise, meaningful comments for complex logic, following JSDoc style for public APIs and interfaces.
- Avoid deeply nested code; prefer breaking logic into smaller, reusable functions or hooks.
- Use `const` for variables that won't be reassigned to improve performance and clarity.
- Ensure all code is type-safe by using TypeScript's strict mode and avoiding `any` types.
- Use ESLint and Prettier to enforce consistent code formatting and catch potential errors.
